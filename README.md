# Research Interests
<p>I am broadly interested in the generation and maintenance of diversity within biofilms, structured communities of microbes adhered to one-another and to a surface through an extracellular matrix composed of proteins, eDNA, and polysaccharides. In particular, I am interested in how these communities, in the natural environment, can select for or against pathogenic traits.</p>

# Active Projects
## Horizontal gene transfer on chitin
<p>Using <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> and microfluidic devices I study how genetic material can be transferred horizontally on chitin surfaces.</p>

## Community assembly on chitin
<p>Using the obligate bacterial predator <em>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</em> and <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> I study how biofilm formation on chitin alters community dynamics in a simple predator-prey system.</p>

## Mechanisms of biofilm formation on chitin
<p><em>Vibrio cholerae</em> encodes a diverse array of secreted proteins which can contribute to biofilm formation. Using chitin under fluid flow I am studying how strains carrying different subsets of proteins form biofilm on chitin.</p>
